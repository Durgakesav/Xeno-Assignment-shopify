# Demo Video Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)

"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to present my solution for the Xeno FDE Internship Assignment. I've built a comprehensive multi-tenant Shopify Data Ingestion & Insights Service that simulates how Xeno helps enterprise retailers onboard, integrate, and analyze their customer data."

## Problem Statement (30 seconds)

"The challenge was to create a system that can:
- Connect to multiple Shopify stores
- Ingest customer, order, and product data
- Provide real-time analytics and insights
- Handle multi-tenancy with data isolation
- Scale for production use"

## Solution Overview (1 minute)

"I built a full-stack application with:
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with PostgreSQL database
- **Frontend**: React dashboard with Material-UI and Recharts
- **Multi-tenancy**: Complete data isolation per store
- **Real-time sync**: Automated data synchronization
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive insights and visualizations"

## Live Demo (4 minutes)

[Show technical aspects]
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Real-time data synchronization
- Error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization

## Architecture & Implementation (1 minute)

### Backend Architecture
"I used a microservices-inspired architecture:
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based user management
- **Tenant Service**: Multi-tenant store management
- **Ingestion Service**: Shopify API integration with automated sync
- **Insights Service**: Analytics data aggregation
- **Scheduler Service**: Background job processing"

### Database Design
"The database uses a multi-tenant design with:
- Complete data isolation per tenant
- Optimized schema for analytics queries
- Proper indexing for performance
- ACID compliance for data integrity"

### Frontend Architecture
"The React frontend features:
- Component-based architecture
- Material-UI for consistent design
- Recharts for data visualization
- Responsive design
- State management with Context API"

## Key Features Demonstrated (30 seconds)

"Key features I implemented:
- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture with data isolation
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization
- ✅ Comprehensive analytics dashboard
- ✅ Automated background sync
- ✅ Webhook support for real-time updates
- ✅ Production-ready deployment
- ✅ Error handling and monitoring
- ✅ Scalable design patterns"

## Technical Decisions & Trade-offs (30 seconds)

"I made several important technical decisions:
- **PostgreSQL**: For ACID compliance and complex analytics queries
- **Prisma ORM**: For type safety and migration management
- **JWT Authentication**: For stateless, scalable authentication
- **Material-UI**: For rapid development and consistent design
- **Recharts**: For performant data visualization"

## Production Readiness (30 seconds)

"The application is production-ready with:
- Docker containerization
- Environment-based configuration
- Health check endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling
- Database migrations
- Security best practices
- Monitoring and logging"

## Next Steps for Production (30 seconds)

"To productionize this solution, I would:
- Add Redis for caching and session management
- Implement message queues for async processing
- Add comprehensive monitoring with tools like DataDog
- Implement advanced security features
- Add automated testing and CI/CD
- Scale horizontally with load balancers"

## Conclusion (30 seconds)

"This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Build complex, multi-tenant applications
- Integrate with external APIs effectively
- Create intuitive user interfaces
- Design scalable database schemas
- Implement real-time data processing
- Deploy and maintain production systems

I'm excited about the opportunity to bring these skills to Xeno and help build amazing solutions for enterprise retailers. Thank you for your time!"
